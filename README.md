Weather report forecasting Analysis &amp; Graphical Speculation on Dashboard by using power bi 
## About the project:
Weather prediction is one of the most certainly required information in all over the regions
It involves collecting global meteorological surface and upper-air observations, preparing global surface and upper air pressure, temperature, moisture, and wind analyses at frequent time intervals based upon these observations we predict some data for upcoming days weather conditions

## Project Description: 

This data contains day wise weather attributes from 2022 to July 2033 (predicted data)
Columns are as follows :
Date
Average temperature (°F)
Average humidity (%)
Average dewpoint (°F)
Average barometer (in)
Average windspeed (mph)
Average gust speed (mph)
Average direction (°degree)
Rainfall for month (in)
Rainfall for year (in)
Maximum rain per minute
Maximum temperature (°F)
Minimum temperature (°F)
Maximum humidity (%)
Minimum humidity (%)
Maximum pressure
Minimum pressure
Maximum wind speed (mph)
Maximum gust speed (mph)
Maximum heat index (°F)

## The Project will consist of 2 modules:
Module 1: Pre-processing, Analysing data using Python and SQL.
Module 2: Visualizing data using Power bi.

## Visualizing data using Power BI.
